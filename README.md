# DTU - [02808] - Personal Data Interaction Spring 2016
# Assignment 1&2

We were given the assignment of creating a prototype initially for an app with the focus on Cognitive Performance Assessment as Personal Data. 

The Cognitive Aspect we chose to focus on was a persons reaction time together with the persons coordination ability.

9.feb - For fun the app prototype was implemented has a pure hack in iOS spritkit( first attempt in using spritekit, bare with me)


[DISCLAIMER]
This is my first try in creating/hacking together a spritekit "game",  there is a high probability that there are areas in the implementation that are not optimal, bare in mind that this project is meant as a quick implementation of a cognitive assessment app.
